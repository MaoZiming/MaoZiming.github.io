<!-- ## Hey there <img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/hvRJCLFzcasrR4ia7z/giphy.gif" width="25px"> -->

Hey, I am Ziming! I am a first-year PhD student at UC Berkeley, working with Prof. <a style="text-decoration:none" href="https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~istoica/" target="_blank">Ion Stoica</a> and Prof. <a style="text-decoration:none" href="https://www2.eecs.berkeley.edu/Faculty/Homepages/shenker.html" target="_blank">Scott Shenker</a>. I graduated from Yale University, with double major in Computer Science and Philosophy. 

Earlier, I was advised by Prof. <a style="text-decoration:none" href="https://www.anuragkhandelwal.com/" target="_blank">Anurag Khandelwal</a>, Prof. <a style="text-decoration:none" href="http://www.cs.yale.edu/homes/radev/" target="_blank"> Dragomir Radev</a> at Yale, and Prof. <a style="text-decoration:none" href="http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~rvinayak/" target="_blank">Rashmi Vinayak</a> at CMU. I am fortunate to work with collaborators from Microsoft Research, NetApp, Facebook AI, Salesforce Research, and Twitter. I was awarded <a style="text-decoration:none" href="https://grad.berkeley.edu/financial/options-for-financial-support/fellowships/" target="_blank"> Berkeley College of Engineering Fellowship</a> (2023), <a style="text-decoration:none" href="https://cra.org/2023-outstanding-undergraduate-researcher-award-recipients/" target="_blank"> Outstanding Undergraduate Researcher Award</a> (2023) Runner-Up, <a style="text-decoration:none" href="https://seas.yale.edu/news-events/news/congratulations-seas-class-2023" target="_blank">Computer Science Prize</a> (2023), and <a style="text-decoration:none" href="https://science.yalecollege.yale.edu/yale-undergraduate-research/fellowship-grants/yale-college-deans-research-fellowship" target="_blank">Rosenfeld Science Scholars Fellowship</a> (2021).

I am currently working on <a style="text-decoration:none" href="https://github.com/skypilot-org/skypilot" target="_blank">SkyPilot</a>, a framework for running LLMs, AI, and batch jobs on any cloud.
