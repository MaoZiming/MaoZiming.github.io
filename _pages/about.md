<!-- ## Hey there <img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/hvRJCLFzcasrR4ia7z/giphy.gif" width="25px"> -->

Hey, I am Ziming! I just graduated from Yale University, with distinctions in both Computer Science (B.S.) and Philosophy (B.A.). I will be joining UC Berkeley for CS PhD working with Prof. <a style="text-decoration:none" href="https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~istoica/" target="_blank">Ion Stoica</a> and Prof. <a style="text-decoration:none" href="https://www2.eecs.berkeley.edu/Faculty/Homepages/shenker.html" target="_blank">Scott Shenker</a>.

I am advised by Prof. <a style="text-decoration:none" href="https://www.anuragkhandelwal.com/" target="_blank">Anurag Khandelwal</a>, Prof. <a style="text-decoration:none" href="http://www.cs.yale.edu/homes/radev/" target="_blank"> Dragomir Radev</a> at Yale, and Prof. <a style="text-decoration:none" href="http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~rvinayak/" target="_blank">Rashmi Vinayak</a> at CMU. I am fortunate to work with collaborators from Microsoft Research, NetApp, Facebook AI, Salesforce Research, and Twitter. I was awarded <a style="text-decoration:none" href="https://cra.org/2023-outstanding-undergraduate-researcher-award-recipients/" target="_blank"> Outstanding Undergraduate Researcher Award</a> (2023) Runner-Up, <a style="text-decoration:none" href="https://seas.yale.edu/news-events/news/congratulations-seas-class-2023" target="_blank">Computer Science Prize</a> (2023), and <a style="text-decoration:none" href="https://science.yalecollege.yale.edu/yale-undergraduate-research/fellowship-grants/yale-college-deans-research-fellowship" target="_blank">Rosenfeld Science Scholars Fellowship</a> (2021).

I am broadly interested in <span style="color:green; font-style:italic">Computer Systems and Networks</span>, and their intersections with <span style="color:green; font-style:italic">Machine Learning</span>. I am currently working on the OS stack for disaggregated memory.
