## Hey there <img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/hvRJCLFzcasrR4ia7z/giphy.gif" width="25px">
I am Ziming! I am a senior at Yale College, pursuing a BS in Computer Science and BA in Philosophy. I am advised by [Prof. Anurag Khandelwal](https://www.anuragkhandelwal.com/), [Prof. Dragomir Radev](http://www.cs.yale.edu/homes/radev/) from Yale, and [Prof. Rashmi Vinayak](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~rvinayak/) from CMU. I am fortunate to work with collaborators from Microsoft Research, NetApp, Facebook AI, Salesforce Research, and Twitter.

I am broadly interested in systems:
* Distributed systems
* Intersection of theory and systems
* Big Data and ML systems
  
For philosophy, I am mostly interested in logic (nonclassical / modal logic) and philosophy of language.
