## Hey there <img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/hvRJCLFzcasrR4ia7z/giphy.gif" width="25px">
I am Ziming! I am a junior at Yale University, pursuing a BS in Computer Science and BA in Philosophy. I am adviced by [Dragomir Radev](http://www.cs.yale.edu/homes/radev/), [Anurag Khandelwal](https://www.anuragkhandelwal.com/) from Yale, and [Rashmi Vinayak](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~rvinayak/) from CMU. I have worked on research collaborations with Microsoft Research, NetApp, Facebook AI, Salesforce Research, and Twitter. 

*I am interested in Big Data Systems, Machine Learning Systems, Cloud Computing, and Distributed Systems.*
